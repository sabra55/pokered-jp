## Too similar to Western versions

The repository currently builds ROMs too similar to the Western releases.

## Pokémon names appear incorrectly

Names of Pokémon appear incorrectly (for example, Squirtle appears as ''けつばん'' (''ketsuban'' Missingno.) instead of ''ゼニガメ'' (''Zenigame'' Squirtle), for unknown reasons (the code has been found to match the Pocket Monsters Red and Green code 1-1).
